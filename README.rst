BioMetAll is a command line application to allow the identification of metal-binding
sites in proteins from backbone preorganization.

Features
--------

**Different options to customize the search:**

- sites with a minimum of coordinating amino acids
- sites with a custom combination of coordinating amino acids
- taking into account coordinations with backbone oxygen atoms (or only with the side chains)
- scanning the whole protein or only a region of interest

**Search for a structural motif and propose mutations:**

- scan the structure to search a specific motif (e.g. HIS,HIS,ASP/GLU)
- propose mutations to complete the motif (e.g. having a HIS,HIS motif, search for mutations to complete with either a GLU or an ASP)

**Possible applications**

- screening of a pool of .pdb structures
- identification of conformational changes that alter the formation of metal-binding sites
- metalloenzyme design

A more complete overview of the capabilities of the program, illustrated with several case studies, is
available in our `ChemRxiv preprint <https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12668651.v1>`_.
