.. tip::

   This executables have been created with `PyInstaller <https://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_ and have been tested on the indicated operating systems. If the executable doesn't work in your specific distribution, it may be due to the lack of some operating system libraries. If that happens, we recommend installing the BioMetAll package from the PyPi repository (see below).
