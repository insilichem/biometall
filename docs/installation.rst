your terminal (Linux/macOS) or command prompt (Win10).

2 - You can install it through the PyPi repository.

Standalone executable
=====================

1 - Download the executable for your Operating System (BioMetAll v1.0):

- `Linux <https://github.com/insilichem/biometall/releases/download/v1.0/biometall_ubuntu>`_. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and 22.04.

- `macOS <https://github.com/insilichem/biometall/releases/download/v1.0/biometall_mac>`_. Tested on macOS 10.15 Catalina.

- `Windows 10 <https://github.com/insilichem/biometall/releases/download/v1.0/biometall.exe>`_. Tested on Windows 10.

.. tip::

   This executables have been created with `PyInstaller <https://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_ and have been tested on the indicated operating systems. If the executable doesn't work in your specific distribution, it may be due to the lack of some operating system libraries. If that happens, we recommend installing the BioMetAll package from the PyPi repository (see below).

   To install packages from the PyPi repository, you must have Python >=3.5 and pip installed in your computer. An expanded explanation of the requirements for installing PyPi packages can be found `here <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#requirements-for-installing-packages>`_.
